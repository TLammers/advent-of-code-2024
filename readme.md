# Advent of Code Challenge 2024
[Challenge Website](https://adventofcode.com/)

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges for 2024.

I'm using Python 3.10.12. These solutions are all my own (though may be influenced by online answers if I get stuck). I use a little help as possible so that I come up with as much of the solutions as I can.


The `functions.py` file that exists in most challenges is simply added to and copied from day to day so that I can use the functions from previous challenges and not deal with Python modules.
